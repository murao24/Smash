		75 total frames in the air. Super armor on frame 8-9 but only on the ground. Unblockable on the ground. Mac is guaranteed KO Uppercut if he takes 100%. Mac is guaranteed KO Uppercut if he deals 333.33*%, as he has a 0.3x unit filling multiplier. Mac is given 4 seconds before he can lose KO Uppercut. Mac loses KO Uppercut if he is sent into tumble, which requires 80 KB Points to do (this can also be taken as ""when you have to tech"" in layman's terms). For more information on Mac's meter, check Plague von Karma's document. Meter filled: 1.05 arrows.
