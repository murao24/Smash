		Tethers from F7 up to 3 times. Untechable spike starting from 46%, KB increases with tether grab distance. However, Rage does not appear to affect this, but freshness and staling do(?). Works as a hitgrab, so it can be shielded. Can be used to get Wall Jumps, from ~F8ish(?). No clue how ride up actually works but it recurs until F16. Frame 11 grounded hit does not occur if done in the air.

		Turn Around window is F12-41. Reversal takes 8 frames. Does stuff with air speed F1-50, F53 adds speed, F60-65 forbids landing while forcing Aymr to pierce the ground, F65-117 does more stuff with air speed, F96 goes back to normal fall speed. Damage-based armor on frames 34—63, but it does not apply when used from the air unless landing on frame 34 or earlier. Damage-based armor takes 36.0% damage in 1v1 and 30% damage in FFA/doubles.
